# django-app
This is a basic Form-based Application built using Python Django Rest Framework and React.js.

The user can simply add the files and relevavnt data using the app directly to the SQL application and it will also show on the frontend in a form of a list. The user can also edit and delete previous data point added to the server.

It was developed during my internship at Jio India (Aug 2020).
